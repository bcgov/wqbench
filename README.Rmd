<!-- badges: end -->

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/wqbench")
```


## Workflow

``` r
library(wqbench)
```

### Create Data Set for App

```r
data_set <- wqb_create_data_set(
  version = 3
)
```

The function will download the US EPA ECOTOX<sup>1</sup> database, create a local .sqlite database, add other data sources and filter conditions, clean and process the data, classify the duration and standardize the effect.

### Generate Benchmark

#### SSD Example

```r
data <- wqb_filter_chemical(data_set, "13463677")
data <- wqb_benchmark_method(data)

data_agg <- wqb_aggregate(data) 
data_agg <- wqb_af(data_agg)
benchmark <- wqb_generate_ctv(data_agg)
```

Plot data set

```r
wqb_plot(data)
```

Plot the results
```r
wqb_plot_det(data_agg)
```

#### Deterministic Example

```r
data <- wqb_filter_chemical(data_set, "1000984359")
data <- wqb_benchmark_method(data)

data_agg <- wqb_aggregate(data) 
data_agg <- wqb_af(data_agg)
benchmark <- wqb_generate_ctv(data_agg)
```

Plot data set

```r
wqb_plot(data)
```

Plot the results
```r
wqb_plot_det(data_agg)
```
