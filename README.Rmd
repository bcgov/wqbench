## Installation


## Workflow

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(wqbench)
```

Download the most recent database 

```r
download_path <- wqb_download_epa_ecotox("data_download")
```

Create a SQLite database 

```r
database_path <- wqb_create_epa_ecotox(
  file_path = "ecotox_db",
  data_path = "data_dl/ecotox_ascii_09_15_2022"
)
```

Add external data sources

```r
# trophic groups
wqb_add_trophic_group(
 database = database_path
) 

# british columbia species 
bc_species <- wqb_add_bc_species(
  database = database_path
) 

```

Filter ECOTOX database to concentration endpoints and aquatic tests 

```r
results_conc_endpoints <- wqb_select_concentration_endpoints(
  database = "ecotox_db/ecotox_ascii_09_15_2022.sqlite"
)

tests_aquatic <- wqb_filter_aquatic_tests(
  database = "ecotox_db/ecotox_ascii_09_15_2022.sqlite"
)
```

Clean up Media Test types to be salt water, fresh water or not reported

```r
media_test <- wqb_add_habitat(
  database = "ecotox_db/ecotox_ascii_09_15_2022.sqlite"
)
```

## External Data Additions and Filters

The extdata folder contains a list of British Columbia species, trophic groups,
and the endpoints selected for the data set. 

These files can be changed to allow for an easy way to make adjustments to the
final outputed dataset.
